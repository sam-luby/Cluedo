project to create the Cluedo boardgame as part of my software engineering module.

board is created in ascii chars in the terminal and is played used WASD controls.

cards are randomly shuffled and assigned.

supports 3-6 named players who each have their own 'notebook.txt' file to keep track of their decisions/outcomes/etc.
